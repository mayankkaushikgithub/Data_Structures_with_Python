Reverse Queue

You have been given a queue that can store integers as the data.
You are required to write a function that reverses the populated queue itself without
using any other data structures.

Input Format:
    The first list of input contains an integer 't' denoting the number of test cases/queries to be run.
    Then the test cases follow.
    The first line input for each test case/query contains an integer N, denoting the total number of elements
    in the queue.
    The second line of input contains N integers separated by a single space, representing the order
    in which the elements are enqueued into the queue.
Output Format:
    For each test case/query, the only line of output prints the order in which the queue elements are
    dequeued, all of them separated by a single space.
    Output for every test case/query will be printed on a new line.

Note:   You are not required to print the expected output explicitly, it has already been taken care of.
        Just make the changes in the input queue itself.
Constraints:        1 <= t <= 100       1 <= N <= 10^4      -2^31 <= data <= 2^31 - 1
Time Limit: 1sec

Sample Input 1:     1                                   Sample Output 1:    10 5 4 3 2 1
                    6
                    1 2 3 4 5 10
Note:  Here, 1 is at the front and 10 is at the rear of the queue.

Sample Input 2:     2                                   Sample Output 2:    10 1 15 8 2
                    5                                                       30 20 10
                    2 8 15 1 10
                    3
                    10 20 30
